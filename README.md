### Project Nineteen - 100DaysOfCode
# Currency Converter
This is a simple program that collects three user inputs (a base currency, an amount, and another currency) and converts the amount from the base currency to the other.

## Background
This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode learning streak. I intend to write a simple python program each day. Each project would:
* be heavily commented for learning purposes;
* include a README file similar to this one;
* include an algorithm to solve it without code;
* include a summary of what I learnt.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Import the appropriate python module.
3. Create variables and assign them the user inputs required for the operation.
4. Using the appropriate method from the module, convert the user input (amount).
6. Print the answer to the screen.
7. Stop.

*NB: Create checks at various points, to evaluate user input. This is to ensure that the required values are being passed from the user input into the various variables.*

## What I've learnt
* This program was my introduction to the python currency module. The documentation is available **[here](https://readthedocs.org/projects/forex-python/downloads/pdf/latest/)**.
* I explored further the use of python the Error Handling technique.
