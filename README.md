### Project Nineteen - 100DaysOfCode
# Currency Converter
This is a simple program that collects three user inputs (a base currency, an amount, and another currency) and converts the amount from the base currency to the other.

## Background
This project is part of my #100DaysOfCode learning streak. I intend to write a simple python program each day. Each project would:
* be heavily commented for learning purposes;
* include a README file similar to this one;
* include an algorithm to solve it without code;
* include a summary of what I learnt.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Define functions to perform the various operations.
3. Create a variable and assign it the user input for a selected operation.
4. Create two variables to hold the operands from the uer.
5. Using if/in and if/else if/else statements, evaluate the user input in line 3 and 4.
6. Print the answer to the screen.
7. Stop.

*NB: Create checks at various points, to evaluate user input. This is to ensure that the required values are being passed from the user input into the various variables.*

## What I've learnt
* This program was my intrudtion to the python currency module.
* I explored further the use of python the Error Handling technique.
